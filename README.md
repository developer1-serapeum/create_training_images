# Main Objective
Create training images for banknote recognition projects when you don't have enough captured images.

# Description
For some projects it is hard to find training images for a data set, for example banknote dataset for a specific country. In this small project I capture finite amount of banknote images (~ 10 per denomination). Afterwards I merge each image to 100 backgorungd, which gives in total 1000 image pre denomination.
